Choosing the right titlepage:

If you want to be on the safe side, choose

(a) titlepage_Bachelor_CID.pdf for a Bachelor's thesis
(b) titlepage_Master_CID.pdf for a Bachelor's thesis

However, the titlepages mentioned above are ugly, but they comply with all CID rules.
You need to have signed the “Antrag auf Verwendung des Logos in der neuen Logosystematik auf einer Prüfungsarbeit” beforehand. You’ll get this sheet from ZPA when register your thesis.

If you are risky and prefer a more beautiful titlepage, choose

(a) titlepage_Bachelor_noCID.pdf for a Bachelor's thesis
(b) titlepage_Master_noCID.pdf for a Bachelor's thesis

However, it cannot be guaranteed that the ZPA will accept them.

Alternatively, pick 

(a) titlepage_Bachelor.pdf for a Bachelor's thesis
(b) titlepage_Master.pdf for a Bachelor's thesis

from the folder "Without RWTH Aachen University Logo".

These titlepages will be accepted, but they omit the chair's logo.
