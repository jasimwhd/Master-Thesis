\chapter{Evaluation}
This section is to guarantee that the results we achieved through our work is not random result but meeting our thesis objectives. \\~\\
The evaluation will be carried out using the Broad GDAC Firehose dataset into two separate categories\cite{https://doi.org/10.7908/c11g0km9}: \\
a) molecular datasets \\
b) clinical datasets \\~\\
It is to be noted that the stability of the results is very important. Hence, we will test the feasibility of our work  against previous methodologies on the same dataset.
